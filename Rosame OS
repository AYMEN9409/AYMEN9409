# Portable Linux-Based OS for aarch64

## Project Overview

We are developing an open-source, portable Linux-based operating system for aarch64 devices. Packaged as an APK (6-10GB), this OS can be used in dual-boot mode with smartphones—no root required—or as a primary boot with root access. Our goal is to create a versatile solution for users seeking enhanced security and functionality in their daily computing tasks.

## Project Goals

- Develop a virtual machine similar to VMOS or VPhoneGaga.
- Embed a secure and protected environment with a Kali Linux-like system and tools.
- Create a user-friendly graphical interface that minimizes the need for terminal commands.

   - Set up communication channels (Discord, Slack, etc.).

4. **Documentation**
   - Write a project proposal detailing goals, architecture, and outcomes.
   - Create a README file for the project repository.

### Phase 2: Development Environment Setup (Months 4-5)

1. **Select Base Distribution**
   - Choose a suitable base Linux distribution (e.g., Debian, Arch) for aarch64.

2. **Set Up Version Control**
   - Create a Git repository for code management.
   - Establish branching strategies and contribution guidelines.

3. **Development Tools**
   - Identify necessary development tools and set up the development environment.
   - Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

### Phase 3: Core Development (Months 6-10)

1. **Bootloader Development**
   - Develop or customize a bootloader for dual-boot functionality.
   - Ensure compatibility with aarch64 devices.

2. **Kernel Customization**
   - Adapt the Linux kernel for aarch64 with necessary patches and configurations.

3. **Virtual Machine Environment**
   - Design and implement the virtual machine architecture.
   - Integrate necessary virtualization technologies (e.g., QEMU, KVM).

4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
   - Develop a user-friendly GUI that simplifies navigation.
   - Incorporate themes and layouts focused on usability.

5. **Kali Linux Integration**
   - Embed a Kali Linux-like system with essential security tools.

### Phase 4: Testing & Feedback (Months 11-12)

1. **Alpha Testing**
   - Conduct internal testing to identify bugs and areas for improvement.

2. **Beta Release**
   - Release a beta version for real-world testing.
   - Gather feedback and prioritize issues.

3. **Iterate and Improve**
   - Make necessary adjustments based on testing feedback.

### Phase 5: Community Building & Documentation (Months 13-15)

1. **Community Engagement**
   - Promote the project on social media and developer communities.
   - Organize events (hackathons, webinars) to engage contributors.

2. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Write detailed documentation for installation, usage, and contributions.

3. **Launch Website**
   - Create a project website to serve as a central hub for information.

### Phase 6: Final Release & Continuous Improvement (Months 16+)

1. **Official Release**
   - Prepare and release the final version of the OS as an APK.

2. **Ongoing Support**
   - Establish a system for reporting bugs and requesting features.

3. **Feature Expansion**
   - Gather community suggestions for new features and enhancements.
